ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
G:\AllAndroidPrograms\Delhi Route Planner Ver 1.0
                           -     -       -   -   

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .idea\
* .idea\.name
* .idea\Delhi Route Planner Ver 1.0.iml
* .idea\compiler.xml
* .idea\copyright\
* .idea\copyright\profiles_settings.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\modules.xml
* .idea\vcs.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml
* planner\
* planner\R.java
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* blackdot.JPG => blackdot.jpg
* callicon.PNG => callicon.png
* care.PNG => care.png
* dtclogo.PNG => dtclogo.png
* dtclogosmall.PNG => dtclogosmall.png
* exitlarge.PNG => exitlarge.png
* gpssmall.PNG => gpssmall.png
* logo.PNG => logo.png
* menuscreen.PNG => menuscreen.png
* officesmall.PNG => officesmall.png
* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* lint.xml => app\lint.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* route.PNG => route.png
* taxilarge.PNG => taxilarge.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
